Script to generate a Cardano address

Commands:

--help -h       To show help (this)

--generate -g   To generate a new Cardano keypair

--qr -q         To obtain the QR version of the generated address (useful when you do not want to
     		expose the seed phrase)


Use the following command to set up the genadakey script:

    pip install -r requirements.txt


To use the script:

1. Set up a path that your newly generated address can go

   e.g. mkdir "wallet"/

   Where the path will be made in the directory you are in

2. Generate a new address to the newly generated path

   e.g. python3 genadakey.py --generate > "wallet/SomeAdaAddress.txt"

   OR

   e.g. ./genadakey.py --generate > "wallet/SomeAdaAddress.txt"

   Note that the second command only works if you have the #!/usr/bin/python3 uncommneted
   and you are in the same directory as the script as well as chmod +x has been applied to
   the script

3. Generate a new address to a newly generated path and save a QR code

   e.g. python3 genadakey.py --generate --qr > "wallet/SomeAdaAddress.txt"

   OR

   e.g. ./genadakey.py --generate --qr > "wallet/SomeAdaAddress.txt"
   

Notes:

1. The QR code will be overwritten each time a new address with the --qr or -q switch is used

2. Before using QR, the --generate or -g switch must be used or the QR code will not work
