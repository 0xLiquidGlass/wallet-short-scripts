Wallet scripts

## Contents
### ethereum/
This directory contains a script, `genethkey.py`, that allows you to generate a new address (keypair) and the resources needed to make the script work properly

To setup `genethkey.py`, do:

`pip install requiements.txt`

To make a new path for your wallet, do:

'mkdir "wallet"`

To generate a new keypair and save it, do:

`python3 genethkey.py --generate > "wallet/SomeEthAddress.txt"`

OR

`python genethkey.py --generate > "wallet/SomeEthAddress.txt"` if you are on Windows

## Donations
This is completely optional. To support me, you can donate to me via this address:

I accept Ethereum and Polygon at the moment. As more scripts for a specific blockchain has been added, I will list those here as a means of donations
